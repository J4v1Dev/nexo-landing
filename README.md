<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 📖 About The Project


**Nexo Landing** is a clean, responsive, and modern landing page developed over the course of three months as the final project for a Web Programming and Design course.

The purpose of Nexo is to serve as the entry point to a future web application that connects users with various types of services and resources through a simple and intuitive interface. From the start, we focused on designing a landing page that is not only visually appealing but also clear in communicating the product’s value.

We aimed to create something better than the typical landing pages found in similar apps — prioritizing usability, accessibility, and clarity, so that even users without prior technical knowledge can navigate and understand what the service offers.

This project represents the foundation of a larger app idea, and the landing was our way of introducing the concept in a professional and elegant way.
